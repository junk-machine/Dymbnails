# Dymbnails
**Create and share dynamic thumbnails**

This is a very old MVC web site that was leveraging XVGML project to render images created by users. *Contributors* could publish their parameterized XVGML drawables, while *regular users* would materialize them into their own images (get a permanent URL).

I originally created this project to generate forum signature banners, which could showcase real-world application of the XVGML format. Given that I could not find any free hosting at that moment, I ditched it.

Happy coding!
